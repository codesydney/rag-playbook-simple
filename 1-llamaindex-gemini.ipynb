       "If a Justice of the Peace has a personal, family, financial, or business interest in a matter and is satisfied that a conflict of interest exists, they should decline to provide services in that matter. JPs should avoid any potential conflicts of interest, whether actual or perceived. If a document is part of a process that will lead to any income or benefit for the JP or their associate, they must not certify or witness the document and should refer the document to another JP.\n",

They must remain independent and impartial, and decline service if a conflict of interest exists. If not reappointed or removed from office, they must immediately stop providing services. They cannot charge a fee or accept gifts for providing services. While they can use the title on business cards or letterheads, they cannot use the title to advance personal, commercial, or business interests.\n",
